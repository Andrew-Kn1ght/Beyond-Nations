# ![Open Source Game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preponderous-Software/osg-project/master/.github/media/banner.svg)

The Open Source Game project is a joint effort between Preponderous Software and the Fairfield Programming Association to create an open source game which will serve as reference material for new developers.

## Getting Started
1. Open Unity Hub.
1. Click the `New Project` button in the top right.
1. Select the `3D` template.
1. Type in the project's name.
1. Select the location to store the project.
1. Choose the editor version at the top of the window (2020.3.21f1 is recommended).
1. Click the `Create Project` button.
1. Open a terminal & navigate to the `Assets` directory of the project.
1. Clone this repository with the following command:
> git clone https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/osg-project
1. Back in Unity, navigate to the `osg-project/src` directory which should now be in the `Assets` folder.
1. Open the `main` scene by double clicking it.

## Troubleshooting
### Missing Editor Version
Attempting to open the repository folder directly as a Unity project will result in a `Missing Editor Version` error. It's recommended to clone the repository inside of the `Assets` folder of an existing empty project.

## Planning Document

The planning document can be found [here](PLANNING.md).
