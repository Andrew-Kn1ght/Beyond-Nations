# ![Open Source Game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preponderous-Software/osg-project/master/.github/media/banner.svg)
The Open Source Game Project is a collaborative effort between Preponderous Software and the Fairfield Programming Association. It aims to create an open-source game that can serve as a reference for aspiring developers.

## Game Concept
In this game, you'll be able to embark on an exciting adventure in a vast procedurally generated world filled with biomes, terrain, and other features.

You'll be able to collect resources and use them to craft items, build structures and manage your territory. You can claim land and build your own nation, or join an existing one. Each nation will have its own unique qualities and will be able to form relations with other nations. You'll be able to interact with other entities in the world, including other players, animals, and NPCs. Citizens will have their own unique personalities and can interact with each other, the player, and the world.

As a leader, you'll need to ensure a prosperous life for your citizens, by providing them with shelter and storage in the buildings you construct. As a citizen, you'll need to provide for yourself and contribute to the nation's economy by collecting resources, crafting items and participating in trade.

Join us on this exciting journey and help us create a game that will inspire and educate aspiring developers.

## Game Systems
There are a number of systems that will be implemented in the game. These systems will be used to create a rich and engaging gameplay experience. Details can be found in the [Systems Document](./docs/SYSTEMS.md).

## Tech Stack
Our game will be built using the following technologies:
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/): This object-oriented programming language will be used to write the game's code.
- [Unity](https://unity.com/): A popular game engine that provides a framework for designing and developing games.
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/): A powerful 3D modeling software that will be used to create the game's visual assets.
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html): A lightweight data format that will be used to store and exchange game data, providing efficient and reliable data persistence.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): A version control system that allows for collaborative development and efficient management of codebase changes.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): A web-based Git repository hosting service that enables version control and collaboration for developers.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A code editor that supports a wide range of programming languages and offers features such as debugging, syntax highlighting, and extensions.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project primarily comes from the Medieval Factions Minecraft plugin. This plugin enables players to create their own nation, claim territory, and form relations with other nations. The plugin is limited because it is designed for a game that is not created for this kind of gameplay. The objective of our project is to develop a game specifically designed for this kind of gameplay.
