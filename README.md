# ![Open Source Game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preponderous-Software/osg-project/master/.github/media/banner.svg)

The Open Source Game project is a joint effort between Preponderous Software and the Fairfield Programming Association to create an open source game which will serve as reference material for new developers.

## Getting Started
1. Create a new blank 3D Unity project.
2. Navigate to the `Assets` directory in a shell.
3. Clone this repository with the following command:
> git clone https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/osg-project
4. You should now be able to access the game assets from inside your editor.

## Troubleshooting
### Missing Editor Version
Attempting to open the repository folder directly as a Unity project will result in a `Missing Editor Version` error. It's recommended to clone the repository inside of the `Assets` folder of an existing empty project.

## Planning Document

The planning document can be found [here](PLANNING.md).
