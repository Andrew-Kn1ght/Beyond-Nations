# Open Source Game Project
The Open Source Game Project is a collaborative effort between Preponderous Software and the Fairfield Programming Association. It aims to create an open-source game that can serve as a reference for aspiring developers.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Open Unity Hub.
1. Click on the New Project button in the top right.
1. Select the 3D template.
1. Name your project and choose where to store it.
1. Select the Unity Editor version (2020.3.21f1 is recommended).
1. Click the Create Project button.
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the Assets directory of the project.
1. Clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/osg-project
```
1. In Unity, navigate to the osg-project/src directory, which should now be in the Assets folder.
1. Double click on the main scene to open it.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter a Missing Editor Version error, it's because you tried to open the repository folder directly as a Unity project. It's recommended to clone the repository inside the Assets folder of an existing empty project.

## Planning Document
You can find the planning document [here](./PLANNING.md).

## Roles
Preponderous Software leads the development of this project and focuses on core elements such as player control, gameplay, story, UI, and more. The Fairfield Programming Association is responsible for community management, deadlines, publishing, press, advertisement, and general assistance with development.
