# Planning Document
The game is set in a procedurally generated world with multiple nations. Players can either start their own nation or join an existing one. The main objective of the game is to claim territory, develop a nation, and ensure a good life for its citizens. The game explores the relationships between nations and citizens of those nations. It is a sandbox game with a focus on emergent gameplay. It is designed to be played in a multiplayer environment, but players can also enjoy it in a single-player environment with a single-player nation.

## Game Systems
The game systems include:

- World Generation
- Nation Building & Management
- NPC Relations
- Resource Collection
- Building Construction
- Life Simulation (stories, resource supply & demand, day-to-day activities)

## Tech Stack
We will be using the following tech stack:

- C# (object code)
- Unity (game engine)
- Blender (3d modeling)
- JSON (data persistence)

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project comes from the Medieval Factions Minecraft plugin. This plugin enables players to create their own nation, claim territory, and form relations with other nations. However, the plugin is limited because it is designed for a game that is not created for this kind of gameplay. The objective of our project is to develop a game specifically designed for this kind of gameplay.
