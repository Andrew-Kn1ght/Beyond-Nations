# Planning Document
The game will take place in a procedurally generated world with a number of nations. Players can start a nation or join an existing one. The primary objective of the game is to claim territory, build a nation & provide a good life for its citizens. Relationships between nations as well as relationships between citizens of nations will be explored. The game will be a sandbox with a focus on emergent gameplay. The game will be designed to be played in a multiplayer environment, but will also be playable in a single player environment with a single player nation.

## Systems

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project is [Medieval Factions](https://github.com/Dans-Plugins/Medieval-Factions), a minecraft plugin that allows players to create their own nation, claim territory & form relations with other nations. The plugin is limited by the fact that it is a plugin for a game that is not designed for this kind of gameplay. The goal of this project is to create a game that is designed for this kind of gameplay.
